    - This study attempts to create an out-of-the-box model that compensates for missing NTLs data using widely available daytime data in a broadly generalizable manner. The proposed project has two objectives: the construction of an image-to-image dataset mapping daytime multispectral images (MODIS V6 Land Surface Reflectance, MODIS V6 Land Cover, MODIS V6 Vegetation Indices) to NTLs (Nighttime Lights) images, and the reconstruction of NTLs data using deep learning techniques by researching, creating, and employing the state-of-the-art architecture of the Mask Partial Convolutional Neural Network in conjunction with dilated convolutions. The project will facilitate the training of new models for predicting missing NTLs and make NTLs data more accessible for future remote sensing research.
